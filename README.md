# Sweet Spot Recipe Exchange

<img src="src/images/website.png"></img>

## Introduction
This was my first full stack web application in which I made an authenticated RESTful app using Node.js, Express, EJS and an external API. I found this project the most difficult because, as well as the coding languages being a new skill, the concept of implementing multiple interconnecting files was also new.

## Objectives

The objectives of this project were:

1) create an authenticated app
2) Create an MVC app using express and EJS
3) Use an external application
4) Style using a CSS framework

I love to bake and keep all these recipes hand written in a big book stained with chocolate and grease. I cant carry this around with me to often find myself away from home and unable to bake my favourite classics I also have friends who bake and we often exchange recipes over Facebook or email. I decided to put all this together in an app where I can write my recipes and access from anywhere and also exchange with friends. So based on the criteria above I thought this would be a great opportunity to create a recipe exchange site.

## Planning

This was my first full stack website so I initially drew the wireframes on paper. I then found an application that I liked to create more detailed wireframes. I decided to use realtimeboard as I liked the flexibility and how simple it was to use. I then transferred the basic hand drawn layout to give more detailed frames on realtimeboard.

After the wireframing I created a flow diagram for how the pages would interconnect and what RESTful actions were necessary.

Finally I wrote out a to-do list so that i could check off tasks as and when I had implemented them.

## Development
## Future Improvements
The main thing that I would like to do with this app is to improve the design and layout. A few other things that I think would improve the site would be to add some options when creating the recipe to choose number of portions, cook time and how easy it is to make. I would also allow the user to add as many lines of method/ingredients as they like. The final thing I would add is nutritional values so that when a recipe is created, the nutritional values would automatically be generated.

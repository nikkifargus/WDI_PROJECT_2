# Sweet Spot Recipe Exchange

## Introduction
This was my first full stack web application in which I made an authenticated RESTful app using Node.js, Express, EJS and an external API. I found this project the most difficult because, as well as the coding languages being a new skill, the concept of implementing multiple interconnecting files was also new.

## Objectives

## Planning

This was my first full stack website so I first found an application that I liked to create the wireframes. I decided to use realtimeboard as I liked the flexibility and how simple it was to use. I initially drew the wireframes on paper and then transferred the basic layout to give more detailed frames on realtimeboard.

After the wireframing I created a flow diagram for how the pages would interconnect and what RESTful actions were necessary.

## Development
## Future Improvements
The main thing that I would like to do with this app is to improve the design and layout. A few other things that I think would improve the site would be to add some options when creating the recipe to choose number of portions, cook time and how easy it is to make. I would also allow the user to add as many lines of method/ingredients as they like. The final thing I would add is nutritional values so that when a recipe is created, the nutritional values would automatically be generated.
